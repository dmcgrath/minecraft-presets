# Just Presets

Below are a superflat presets for Minecraft designed to be more usable for survival games than the stock presets found in the game.

### Standard world

Standard world gives you a lot of the features you find in a regular minecraft work. Featuring 80 levels of stone that can spawn minerals and ore from coal to diamonds, topped off with a single layer of sand and then several layers of dirt/grass. In this preset you will find dungeons, mineshafts, villages and a stronghold, so you should be able to find or trade for most items available in the default world.

### Water Table

Water Table is much like Standard World, except for an 8 layer water level between the sand dirt layers. Be careful not to flood our your mining expeditions!

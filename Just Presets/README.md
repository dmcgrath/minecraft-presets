# Just Presets

Below are a superflat presets for Minecraft designed to be more usable for survival games than the stock presets found in the game.

### Standard world

Standard world gives you a lot of the features you find in a regular minecraft work. Featuring 80 levels of stone that can spawn minerals and ore from coal to diamonds, topped off with a single layer of sand and then several layers of dirt/grass. In this preset you will find dungeons, mineshafts, villages and a stronghold, so you should be able to find or trade for most items available in the default world.

### Water Table

Water Table is much like Standard World, except for an 8 layer water level between the sand dirt layers. Be careful not to flood our your mining expeditions!

### Subterranean Lake

Be careful when digging! The water table has receded, leaving a gap between the dirt an water. This makes a convenient 24 hour boating area once you build lighting and docks.

### Subterranean Glacier

There is plenty of water, although you'll have to unfreeze it first. This is what happened to the Subterranean Lake during the next ice age. Morning dew has seeped underground and frozen on the ceiling. The seed `Icy` is a good one for this preset, with a lava lake spawning close to help you out.

### Jungle Romp

Meow? The sooner you can find a lake and catch some fish, the easier your life will be. There are plenty of Jungle temples to raid and underground mineshaft labyrinths to explore while you build out yoru jungle oasis.

Witches and slimes will be a blessing and a curse on this preset that brings ores a little closer.
